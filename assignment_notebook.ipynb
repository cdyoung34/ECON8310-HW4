    "A/B Testing is a critical concept in data science, and for many companies one of the most relevant applications of data-driven decision-making. In order to improve product offerings, marketing campaigns, user interfaces, and many other user-facing interactions, scientists and engineers create experiments to determine the efficacy of proposed changes. Users are then randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group, and their behavior is recorded.\n",
    "If the changes that the treatment group is exposed to can be measured to have a benefit in the metric of interest, then those changes are scaled up and rolled out to across all interactions.\n",
    "Below is a short video detailing the A/B Testing process, in case you want to learn a bit more:\n",

    "For this assignment, you will use an A/B test data set, which was pulled from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yufengsui/mobile-games-ab-testing). I have added the data from the page into Codio for you. It can be found in the cookie_cats.csv file in the file tree.
